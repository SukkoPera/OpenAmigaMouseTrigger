# OpenAmigaMouseTrigger
OpenAmigaMouseTrigger is an Open Hardware PCB that allows using the state of the mouse buttons at power-up of an Amiga computer to trigger features of other boards, instead of using physical switches. This is mainly useful for controlling a [Kickstart Switcher](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenKickstartSwitcher) or a *DF0 Switcher*.
